In our poll application, we’ll have the following four views:

1. Question “index” page – displays the latest few questions.
2. Question “detail” page – displays a question text, with no results but with a form to vote.
3. Question “results” page – displays results for a particular question.
4. Vote action – handles voting for a particular choice in a particular question.
